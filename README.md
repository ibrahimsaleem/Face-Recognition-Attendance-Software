# Face-Recognition-Attendance-Software
In Face recognition faces are detected in the image and then these detected faces are compared with the database for verification, if a match is found attendance is marked with exact date and time .This marked attendance is stored in csv file.  I have developed this face recognition Attendance system using Python. It is connected to an SQL database to store student details and attendance information. OpenCV and PIL libraries are used to capture the faces of student and store them in an image file. LBPH Face recognizer algorithm is used which is one of the easiest algorithms for face detection. HaarCascade frontal face algorithm is used which identifies the faces in an image. Tkinter is used to create user interface and datetime library is used to record attendance in real time. This recorded attendance can be exported using an excel or csv file.
